# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

Middleware function typically isn't seen by the client while a normal controller can be seen by the client.

# Teacher Feedback

Not entirely wrong, the answer we were looking for however is that the middleware function will not send a response but rather will redirect to the next controller!
